# Overview
As a software engineer I am continuing my learning by expanding my learning and capabilities with unique programs in different languages.  This program is borrows heavily on my experience in finance and is an excellent example on how finance and technology come together to help users.  After research and planning I have created this program as an artifact of what I have learned so far. 

### Description
This is a program created after a brief introduction to Kotlin.  This project uses components such as classes, conditions, functions, variable declaration and manipulation.  Additionally there are coding principles used such as abstraction, inheritance, and maintainability.

### Purpose
This program will help potential buyers determine their purchasing power based on the information they provide.  The target audience is specifically for individuals that are needing to make a purchase based on payments (aka payment buyers).  Cash buyers (buyers that don't want payments) will be supported in a future release.

# Future Work

- Something to Fix: String formatting, to have a cleaner representation of USD precision.
- Something to Improve: Include a debt load calculation for savings (expanding the debt class).
- Something to Add: A feature that observes cash buyers and not only payment buyers.
